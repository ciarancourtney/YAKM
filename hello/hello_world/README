## How to run hello_world                  

The bundled program hello_world.c contains code to call the added system call. 

To compile it, use the following command:        

    make hello_world

You should now have an executable that you can execute using:

    ./hello_world

The ouput should be:

    Hello_world returned 0

You can check that the call worked by checking the linux kernel log, typically /var/log/syslog or dmesg

### Appendix

-All above commands assume that you have permission to run them, if you try to run them in place i.e in /usr/src you will need to be root (prepend sudo to commands)

-The hello_world program is already compiled into an executable for handiness, but it will only run on x86_64, to run on x86 you will need to change the syscall(545) to the right value for x86, "358"
